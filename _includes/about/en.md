> When I was a young man, I had liberty, but I did not see it. <br>
I had time, but I did not know it. <br>
And I had love, but I did not feel it.<br>
Many decades would pass before I understood the meaning of all three. <br>
And now, the twilight of my life, this understanding has passed into contentment.<br>
Love, liberty, and time: once so disposable, are the fuels that drive me forward. <br>
And love, most especially, mio caro. <br>
For you, our children, our brothers and sisters. <br>
And for the vast and wonderful world that gave us life, and keeps us guessing.<br>
Endless affection, mia Sofia.<br>
Forever yours, Ezio Auditore.<br>
